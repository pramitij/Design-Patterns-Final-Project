##Summary:

Weâ€™ve implemented an Inventory Management System using different design patterns
to build a robust and flexible web application that helps manage inventory for a retail store.
The application allows users to add new products, edit existing products, and delete products that are no longer needed.
The application is built using Java and Spring Boot on the back-end, and React.js on the front-end.

###We have demonstrated the use of the following Design Patterns:

Abstract Factory
Command
Strategy
State
Observer
Factory
Facade
Decorator

##Tech Stack:

###Programming Languages:
Java
JavaScript

###Frameworks:
Spring Boot (Backend)
React (Front End)

###Libraries:
React.js (for building UI components)
Axios (for making HTTP requests)
Bootstrap (for styling UI components)
Spring Data JPA (for querying and updating
database)
Hibernate (for mapping Java objects to database
tables)
Log4j (for logging and debugging)


##Operating instructions:

1. Clone Repo from github

`git clone https://github.com/pramitij/Design-Patterns-Final-Project.git`

2. Ensure the IDE you are using has all the required dependencies

3. Setup Standard MySQL Database connection to the localhost on port 3306

4. Crete a schema named `myinventory`

5. Run the `Main` method from `InventoryManagementApplication` class

6. Once that runs successfully, open a new terminal window and navigate to the FrontEnd directory

7. Run `npm install`

8. Run `npm start`

9. View the running application on your Browser
